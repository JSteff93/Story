Breeding in Palworld can be complicated. If both parents are the same species of Pal, you will get a third of that species—that’s the easy part. When you breed Pals of two different species, it results in a totally random but fixed offspring. That is, there is pretty much no rhyme or reason behind the results of crossbreeding, but the result of any given combination is always consistent.
